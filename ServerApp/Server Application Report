Server Application Report
Overview
The ServerApp is a Windows Forms application designed for network communication and client management. It leverages a server-client model, where the server part is encapsulated in this application. The key functionalities revolve around handling network connections, managing client requests, and providing a user interface for interaction and status monitoring.

Core Components
TCP Server (TcpServer.cs)

This component acts as the backbone of the ServerApp, handling the TCP/IP connections.
It listens for incoming client connections on a specified port (default is 8848).
The server can be started and stopped, providing control over network operations.
ServerForm (ServerForm.cs)

The main window or user interface of the application.
It initiates the TCP server on application start.
Provides a method (UpdateStatusLabel) to update a status label on the form, which is useful for displaying real-time status messages.
Handles the server shutdown process when the application is closed.
Program (Program.cs)

Entry point of the application.
Sets up the basic application environment and starts the main form (ServerForm).
It holds a static reference to ServerForm, making it accessible throughout the application.

Summary
The ServerApp is a comprehensive tool for managing network connections and client interactions in a server-client architecture. The application combines network handling capabilities with a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for scenarios where constant monitoring and control over client connections are required. The ability to start/stop the server and real-time updates enhances its usability in dynamic network environments.
